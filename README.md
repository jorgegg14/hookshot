## Features

- **Reliable Delivery**: Ensures that webhooks are delivered even in case of temporary failures.
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed deliveries based on configurable settings.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Gradually increases the wait time between retries to avoid overwhelming the target server.
- **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Stores failed messages for later inspection and reprocessing.
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitor the status of each webhook delivery.
- **Built with Node.js**: Utilizes the power of Node.js for efficient handling of asynchronous operations.
- **Job Queue with BullMQ**: Leverages BullMQ for managing job queues effectively.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Designed to fit seamlessly into event-driven systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with Hookshot, you can check the [Releases](https://github.com/jorgegg14/hookshot/releases) section for the latest version. Download the appropriate file, and follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jorgegg14/hookshot.git
   cd hookshot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:

   Ensure you have PostgreSQL running. Create a database for Hookshot and update the configuration accordingly.

4. **Run the Application**:

   You can start the application using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Check the Status**:

   Monitor the application logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.

## Usage

Hookshot can be integrated into your existing systems to handle webhook deliveries. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to send a webhook:

```javascript
const Hookshot = require('hookshot');

const hookshot = new Hookshot({
    db: {
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'youruser',
        password: 'yourpassword',
        database: 'yourdatabase'
    }
});

hookshot.sendWebhook('https://example.com/webhook', { data: 'your data' })
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Webhook sent successfully:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Failed to send webhook:', error);
    });
```

## Configuration

Hookshot allows you to configure various settings to tailor the service to your needs. Here are some of the key configuration options:

- **Database Configuration**: Set the database connection parameters.
- **Retry Settings**: Configure the number of retries and the delay between attempts.
- **DLQ Settings**: Specify how long to retain failed messages in the dead-letter queue.

You can set these configurations in a `.env` file or directly in the code.

## How It Works

1. **Webhook Creation**: When you send a webhook, Hookshot creates a job in the BullMQ queue.
2. **Job Processing**: The job is processed by a worker that attempts to deliver the webhook.
3. **Delivery Attempt**: If the delivery fails, the worker will retry based on the configured settings.
4. **Success or Failure**: On success, the job is marked as completed. On failure, it is either retried or sent to the DLQ.
5. **Monitoring**: You can track the status of deliveries through the provided APIs.
